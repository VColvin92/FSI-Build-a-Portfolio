    <p>My <i>favorite</i> thing about programming is the complexity but also the freedom that comes from being able to instruct the computer exactly how you want to within the means of the project boundaries. This page will be a sum of all my collective efforts during this entire software developement bootcamp. My goal with this page isn't to showcase the sum total of my skills at the end of the program but more so to be used as a familiar testbed for my experiments with the new information and skills I am learning and a place to get comfortable with web manipulation. My overall goal with this first page is to cut my teeth here first, so when my actual professional portfolio, that I will parade in front of employers, is done it will actually be the sum total of my skills at that time.</p>
